Hover Card (Drupal)
=========

Hovercard is a module which is based on hovercard, a free light weight jQuery
plugin that enables you to display related information with the hovered label,
link, or any html element of your choice. This module extends Drupal to provide
Hovercard for the users of the website.

  - Easy to install and use.
  - Works on all user links with "username" as their class.
  - Simply install it and see the magic!
